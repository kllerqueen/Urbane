            <p class="bold-16 mb-2">WHO are we?</p>
            <p>When we say <strong>"Urbane"</strong>, <strong>"us"</strong>, <strong>"our"</strong> or <strong>"we"</strong>, we refer to, depending on whom you share your data with as further described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="w-[1338px] px-10 regular-14 mb-5">
            <p class="bold-16 mb-2">WHAT data may we collect about you?</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><strong>"Personal Data"</strong> means any information that could identify you either directly (e.g., your name) or indirectly (e.g., through a unique client ID number, address, date of birth, phone number, e-mail address, gender, payment/banking details, purchase history and/or photo).</p>
            <p class="mb-2">You acknowledge that all Personal Data that you have provided or will provide is yours to share and is true and accurate.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">The Personal Data we collect depends upon the touchpoint of our interaction and is also limited to that which is relevant and appropriate for the interaction. Website visitors who browse Urbane and view our products, information and offerings can choose to do so without identifying themselves, and the same applies to in-store and social media browsing.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Unless you choose to interact with us via those touchpoints, such as by making a purchase on our site, signing up for one of our programs or services, or posting a comment or a like online, our data collection is limited to the use of ‘cookies’ for website visitors.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">For customers and other individuals who sign up for programs or services, we must collect certain relevant information from you. The information we collect is related to the particular transaction as well as our overall relationship with you. For example, if you make purchases from Urbane or in our stores, we must collect information to process (and, if relevant, fulfill and ship) your order. For customers and other individuals who sign up for our programs or services, we generally collect your contact details, contact preferences, and information that will allow us to make recommendations to you about our products or services that may be of interest. We may centralize the information pertaining to our customers so that we have it organized in one place, as this helps us manage our relationship with you as well as your choices and preferences.</p>

In the event of modification of this Privacy Policy, we will ensure that you are informed of these changes either by a special notice on our site, or by a personalized warning notably in the context of our newsletters.</p>
